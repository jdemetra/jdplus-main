## [3.0.1] - 2023-05-11

This is a **patch release** of JDemetra+ v3.0.1.  
Its sole purpose is to simplify the installation by providing Windows-specific binaries in addition to the platform-independent packages.
These binaries are self-sufficient and therefore don't require Java anymore.

Install instructions are available at https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main#installing.

### Added

- ![OTHER] Add Windows binaries to release

## [3.0.0] - 2023-05-02

This is the **initial release** of JDemetra+ v3.0.0.
