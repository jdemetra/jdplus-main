Its sole purpose is to simplify the installation by providing Windows-specific binaries in addition to the platform-independent packages.
These binaries are self-sufficient and therefore don't require Java anymore.

Install instructions are available at https://github.com/jdemetra/jdplus-main#installing.

### Added

- ![OTHER] Add Windows binaries to release

## [3.0.0] - 2023-05-02

This is the **initial release** of JDemetra+ v3.0.0.  
[Java SE 17 or later](https://whichjdk.com/) version is required to run it.
